# Microscopic-Behavior-Simulation-for-Investors
This project is the simulation of the investors' behavior in the stock market with certains assumptions

## Part1. The Financial Market
  - The calculation about daily log-return
  - The distribution of the historic daily return and the fitting of the distribution
 
## Part2. The State of the Market
  - The algorithm of Louvain by the method of MacMahon and Garlaschelli

## Part 3 The simulation of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo
  ### 3.1 The basic properties about Grand Canonical Monte Carlo
  - Construction of the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo model
  - Simulate the GCMC dynamic model with different assumption and situation
  - Analyse the previsibility of the financial market 
  - The impact of volatility
   ### 3.2 The P&L of the investors.
  - The average return of the investors
  - The average return of the investors with different ratio of the investors(investor and arbitrageurï¼‰
  - The variance of the P&L for investors
  - The conditional gain
